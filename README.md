#Concept of The project|
------------------------
  The idea is simple, You have two stacks called Stack A and Stack B.
Stack A is given a random list of unorganized numbers.

  You must take the random list of numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest.
There are only a few moves youâ€™re allowed to use to manipulate the stacks.

The main goal of this project is to organize Stack A in as few actions as possible.

The moves are named: sa, sb, ss, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr, pa, pb.

linked list is easier to implement these moves :

sa || sb : Swap 2 first elements of the stack.
